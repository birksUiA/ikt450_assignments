  Abstract
])

This collections of pages contains the thoughts and results from the weekly assignments in IKT450 Deep Neural Networks.
The deal with networks of continued complexity and mordantly, starting with the simple KNN algorithm, followed by different applications of feed forward networks, convolutional networks and finally Recurrent Neural networks and auto encoders.
